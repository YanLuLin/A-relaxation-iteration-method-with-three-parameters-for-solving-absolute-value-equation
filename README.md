A relaxation iteration method with three parameters for solving absolute value equation.

Example 1. Consider the AVE with the tridiagonal coefficient matrix A=tridiag(−1,4,−1), where x_star= (1,2,1,2,••• ,1,2)^T is the exact solution of AVE.

Example 2. Consider the AVE with block tridiagonal coefficient matrix A=M_hat+uI,where M_hat=tridiag(−I,S,−I) with S=tridiag(−1,4,−1),n=m^2,x_star= (-1,1,-1,1,••• ,-1,1)^T is the exact solution of AVE.

Example 3. Consider the AVE with block tridiagonal coefficient matrix A=M_hat+uI,where M_hat=tridiag(−1.5I,S,−0.5I) with S=tridiag(−1.5,4,−0.5),n=m^2,x_star= (-1,1,-1,1,••• ,-1,1)^T is the exact solution of AVE.

All test problems are performed by MATLAB R2016B on a personal computer with 2.50 GHz central processing unit (Intel(R) Xeon(R)E5-2678v3), 32GB RAM running Windows 10.
